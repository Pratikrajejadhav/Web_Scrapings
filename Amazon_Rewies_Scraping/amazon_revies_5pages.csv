Jnan Shetty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-
1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User
2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.
3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.
4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.
5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.
6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.
7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.
8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.
9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.

These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things."
vaibhav,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I snagged the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival for an unbeatable price of 45,000, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in every way!

Screen: The display is absolutely stunning – crisp, vibrant, and the colors pop like never before. Watching videos or scrolling through photos is a treat for the eyes. No complaints here!

Hanging: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. This phone handles multitasking like a champ. Switching between apps is smooth, and I haven't experienced any frustrating delays.

Battery: The battery life is surprisingly impressive. I can go a full day with normal usage, and it still has juice left in the tank. No more anxiously searching for a charger midday – a definite win!

Comfort: The sleek design makes it a pleasure to hold, and the phone is just the right weight. It feels premium and comfortable in my hand, making it a joy to use for extended periods.

Image Quality: The camera on the iPhone 13 is a true standout. The photos are sharp, and the night mode is a game-changer for capturing memories in low light. Selfies have never looked this good!

Color: I went for the classic Midnight color, and it's elegant and timeless. The finish adds a touch of sophistication, and it doesn't attract fingerprints like some other phones I've had in the past.

In summary, getting the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival was an absolute steal. From the incredible screen to the reliable battery life and stunning camera, it's exceeded my expectations. If you're on the fence, take the plunge – you won't be disappointed."

ApTreX,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.
I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!
I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.

iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.

I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.

Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.
I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.

You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.

Speakers are Great.

Battery life is better than my previous devices,
iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.
NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.

For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.

But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.
Truly worth it."
NEHA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product.. I love android and apple both, both have different characters I see. When it comes to iphone 13, I love the camera( great pictures), sound(like a surround sound), software, quality, smoothness etc it offers and with style and premiumness. It's not only about the style but really and honestly, overall the product is great. One should use it and realize how great and satisfying this brand and product is.. Great brand.. Go fot it if you could, you'll not regret.."
Siva,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone. Delivery also good. But invoice should contain IMEI number of iphone along with model details.

Rahul Moghe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Writing this review after using the phone for 5 months.
Pros
- camera clicks amazing pictures, video recording is the best I've seen in a phone so far compared to my previous phones. Stable videos with no shaking
- battery life is good. Lasts an entire day with medium use. I don't game on the phone. Charging is as quick as it is with phones that use USB C.
- display is soo good. So bright
- built is solid, dropped phone a couple of times once with the cover and once without and not even a scratch.
- listening to music and watching videos is a hot cos of how good the speakers r. Crystal clear with the right amount of bass and treble.

Cons
- phone is a tad heavy and using it for hrs on a stretch can result in pain in the wrist or fingers

Got the phone in Diwali sale on discount so bang for buck if u ask me"

"Great product, Good pricing",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The first time I am purchasing a apple product, and I am really happy with the product, performance and the delivery."
Akshay Mokashi,5.0 out of 5 stars,.
debarghyo chaudhuri,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:
Product red 128GB
Pros:
1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)
2) Built quality excellent
3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.
4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.
5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.
6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.
7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thump

Cons:
1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.
2) File management system sucks, android is much better.
3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.
4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.
5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.
6) No USB C
7) Siri is dumb AF
8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.
9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.
10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.
11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16

Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.

Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.

Hope this helps in making your decision easier.

Update after 2 weeks of usage:

All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.
1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.
2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone."

Aditi Mukherjee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just love this model! Yes please would argue that it’s an old model but hear me out. The battery backup is substantially better than 14/15. The camera quality stands at power, the charging even tho not C type charges pretty quickly, the base and the speakers it’s pretty good. And even though the refresh rate is not that great, but it’s the exact same in 14/15.
Not just that but there have been certain major issues with both those models that have put them on a really low selling models for Apple."

Srimukh Reddy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Still trying to understand the computations on one hand and to understand shift from android to iphone
I thought hanging would never happen but it seems as if you would just need to optimise your usage among different apps and understand the shift better.
If you are trying to shift from androud its best to try pro or pro max so that you wouldnt notice the shift"

Placeholder,3.0 out of 5 stars,"7 Days used review . The ordering experience in the greate indian sale was worst . I planned to buy this for 45999/- in oct7 greate indian sale offer but i got canceled then i bought for 48999 that was disppointed .
Coming to phone
IOS 16.6 (current not updated)
- it was great, super handy for me, little feeling of weight .
Display
- The 60Hz refresh rate didn't felt badly form me cause i am used such kind of device before.
- The brightness Range is so comfortable.
- The 2160p60 HDR videos in youtube give blissful experiance
Battery And charging
- The charging time:- i took 1Hour to charge from 20% to 91% using apple 20w original adapter without any interruption
- Battery backup - I am mostly maintain battery in btw 20% <-> 80% so i think this may get one day backup for me ,Average 5h screen on time
- Little temperature warming while charging , no heating issue
Perfomance
- Good perfomance for video editing ,photography , social media . (I am not a gamer )
Camera
- The cinematic Mode is mind Blowing . i missed 13 pro or higher varients for zooming in this mode .
- Actually i really miss pro variant for the tele lens and camera features while i using this . Cost is wall for me.
- The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .
- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.
AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATE
i turned off the auto update at first place .
i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.
So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened . Buy the way it is a hardware issue one of the display provider company's batch may show the issues . but we customers cannot identify which company provides the hardaware.
I will attach my battery analytics data screnshot photo here so you can better understand how the battery is good"

The camera quality is a standout feature, capturing vivid and detailed photos in various lighting conditions.

The Cinematic mode for videos adds a professional touch, creating engaging and dynamic content.

The battery life has been reliable, easily lasting a full day with moderate usage. The 120Hz ProMotion display contributes to a silky-smooth experience, enhancing gaming and video playback.

The design is sleek and feels premium, while the Ceramic Shield front provides added durability. The introduction of 5G connectivity ensures fast data speeds, enhancing the overall user experience.

While the absence of a charger and earphones might be a drawback for some, the iPhone 13’s performance, camera capabilities, and design make it a worthwhile upgrade. Highly recommended for those seeking a top-tier smartphone experience."
